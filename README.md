# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survivor Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to estimate which passengers survived the Titanic disaster. It uses information such as age, sex, and socio-economic status to predict whether a passenger survived or not. The project also includes data visualization, data storytelling, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## ðŸ“‚ Content
- **Dataset:** Titanic Dataset  
- **Visualization:** Correlation Heatmaps, Distribution Graphs, Histograms  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Missing Value Handling, Imputation, Scaling, Binary and One-hot Encoding  
- **Model:** Logistic Regression  
- **Model Evaluation:** Cross-validation, Grid Search

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Numpy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Plotly  
- Scikit-Learn  

## ðŸ“Š About the Dataset
The **Titanic Dataset** consists of **12 columns**, including personal and travel-related details. The target variable is **Survived**, which depends on other features. Most passengers have information such as name, age, sex, fare, class, and port of embarkation.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Features
- **PassengerId:** Passenger ID number  
- **Survived:** Whether the passenger survived (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive)  
- **Pclass:** Socio-economic status (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower)  
- **Name:** Full name of the passenger  
- **Sex:** Gender of the passenger  
- **Age:** Age of the passenger  
- **SibSp:** Number of siblings or spouses aboard  
- **Parch:** Number of parents or children aboard  
- **Ticket:** Ticket number  
- **Fare:** Fare paid by the passenger  
- **Cabin:** Cabin number  
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
